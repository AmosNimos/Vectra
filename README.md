# VecTra CLI OBJ Editor
Etymology: VecTra stands for Vector Tracing. The name was chosen because "Vertex Tracing" would result in "Vertra," which didnâ€™t sound as appealing.

VecTra is an early-stage command-line interface (CLI) tool for basic 3D object editing using the OBJ file format. Currently, it serves as a proof of concept and lays the groundwork for a more complete 3D editor/CAD program.

## Vision

VecTra is designed to provide a simple way to create and manipulate low-poly 3D models. It is built in Python and is intended to evolve into a more feature-rich tool over time.

## Current Features

- **Axis Control:** Basic controls for manipulating vertices along different axes.
- **Basic Camera Movement:** Initial support for moving the camera to view models from various angles.

## Installation

No installation is needed at this stage. Download the source code and run it directly from your CLI.

## Usage

VecTra is currently in the proof of concept phase. Command details and a full manual will be provided as development progresses. For now, you can interact with the tool using basic commands within the app.

## Limitations

- **Single Object Editing:** At this stage, VecTra supports editing only one object at a time.
- **Low-Poly Focus:** Optimized for low-poly models; support for high-poly models is not yet implemented.
- **Incomplete Features:** Many features, including axis control and camera movement, are still under development and may not be fully functional.

## Future Plans

Once the project is more developed, a comprehensive manual will be added to provide detailed usage instructions and additional information about the features.
